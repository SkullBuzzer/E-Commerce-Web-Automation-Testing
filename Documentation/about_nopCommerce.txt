nopCommerce is the best open-source eCommerce shopping cart solution. nopCommerce is free, and it is the most popular ASP.NET eCommerce platform. 
The first nopCommerce version was released in 2008. At that time there were no free and open-source shopping carts that would not impose the limitations 
on business processes and 
flow hence the essential goal for nopCommerce was to fix that.

The high quality of the product and its constant development led to creating the global nopCommerce community of over 250,000 members. 
The philosophy of the open-source product allows us to receive the contribution of developers and businesses from around the world. 
That helps us to grow faster and meet the highest security and technology standards.
